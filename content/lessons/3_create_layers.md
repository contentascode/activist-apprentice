# Introduction | 3 Minutes

Layers help the two-dimensional space of a photo better represent the three-dimensional world. This lesson will teach you the basic steps to create photos with layers.

The most basic way to use layers is with two distinct layers: a subject layer and a context layer. The context layer provides additional information related to your subject.

[Subject Layer](images/2.jpg)

In this photo the subject layer is in color.

The subject layer shows the main subject of your photo. This is usually a person or an object. The subject layer is often placed in the foreground layer of your frame.

[Context Layer](3.jpg)

In this photo the context layer is in color.

The context layer is often the background layer. It helps the viewer better understand a subject''s environment or an important detail of the story. In this photo the context layer tells the viewer the women are at a protest.

Sometimes the layers are reversed, here the context layer is in the foreground.

This image highlights the context of the story — the game — by placing it in the foreground and placing the subject in the background.

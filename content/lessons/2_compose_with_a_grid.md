### Introduction | 3-5 Minutes

Using a grid to compose photos is the most basic concept a photographer needs to understand. This lesson will teach you to look at your photo as a grid.

Think of your photo as if it is made up of nine equal rectangles. Strong visuals use all the rectangles in the grid to tell the story.

Placing the grid on this photo divides one image into nine equal rectangles.

Most smartphones allow you to display a grid in your camera app. Use the grid when doing the activity.

Do not place your subject in the middle with no thought to the rest of the grid.

The grid is intended to do more than center your photos. Letâ€™s look at how the lines of the grid help us compose better photos.

This line defines the bottom third of the frame.

If the photo is a landscape, this line is often used to establish the horizon in a grid.

This line defines the top third of the frame.

If the photo is a portrait, the subject''s eyes are usually placed on the top horizontal line. As you practice this more you may find that sometimes the bottom line works better.

The grid allows you to arrange complex images in a single frame.

To use a grid most effectively, the vertical and horizontal lines should work together to define the frame.

Clearly define the edges of your frame. Try to have important shapes complete within the frame.

Remember to fill the entire frame with visual information. Use the grid to organize that information and create more compelling photos.

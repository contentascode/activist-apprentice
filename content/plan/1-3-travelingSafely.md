## 1.3 TRAVELING SAFELY

Bad choices are the most common risk. These rules will help you avoid bad choices:

---

* **TELL SOMEONE WHERE YOU ARE GOING** If no one knows where you are, they won’t know you are at risk.

* **TRAVEL IN PAIRS** Travel with a friend to use as a lookout. Traveling alone puts you at risk.

* **KNOW YOUR ROUTE** Life is unpredictable. Plan for this. Needing directions in a risky situation increases risk.  

* **KNOW YOUR SURROUNDINGS** Keep an eye on what’s around you. Forgetting to watch your surroundings puts you at risk.

* **KNOW YOUR FRIENDS** Before you depend on someone, be sure you know who they are. Friends reduce risk if they are reliable; if not, they increase risk.

* **KNOW YOUR EXIT** When it’s time to go, know where to go. If you don’t know your exit you put yourself at risk.

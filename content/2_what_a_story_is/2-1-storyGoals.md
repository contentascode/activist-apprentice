## 1.2 COMMUNICATE SAFELY

Whether you are doing reporting, documenting your friends, or promoting a political movement, you may be at risk from electronic observation. Technical or electronic safety depends on your communications. You should observe proper security practices in all forms of electronic communication.

# KNOW YOUR CONNECTION.

# IF YOU DON'T CONTROL IT, DON'T TRUST IT.

If you are using a computer that is not your own, assume everything can be observed even if it says it is secure (https, encrypted, etc). Keyloggers, false SSL certificates, and other monitoring software are all easy to install.

Never post something from work computer or an Internet cafe computer and expect it to be anonymous - ever. Use your own PC or laptop and boot from a live cd if possible.*

*We advise you use ubuntu to use as an easy option for using a live cd.*

## PHONE

Each phone has a unique identity. Unless you obtain an anonymous phone, nothing you say is private. To communicate privately, make calls only between anonymous phones.  

A measure of security is possible over VOIP clients like Skype but is by no means 100% secure.

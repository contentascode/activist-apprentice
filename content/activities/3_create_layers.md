# Introduction | 10 Minutes


Now that you've completed the lesson on creating layers in a photo, this activity will help you practice. Start by taking photos with two distinct layers, one with a clear subject and another that provides context.

Place the subject or character in a distinct layer from the rest of the image. (Character Clip, length 20 seconds)
